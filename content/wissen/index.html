<p>Diamonds have long captured the imagination of the rich and poor, the young and old, the romantics and even the realists. Their beauty and value has made them highly desirable, whether you’re looking at them as a solid investment or wanting to present the perfect symbol of your feelings for someone special. But not all diamonds are equal, and a fancy color diamond is the perfect example of that. A fancy color diamond is one that is not colorless like the typical diamonds with which you may already be familiar. They are diamonds that occur naturally in every color of the rainbow, from brilliant oranges to deep reds, sunshine yellows and velvety black. The fancy or naturally colored diamond is more dazzling and rare than typical colorless diamonds, as it is harder to nature to produce a diamond with color than a diamond with no color at all. Everyone who looks at these diamonds is naturally drawn to a specific color and preference is determined based solely on personal taste.</p>

<p>The natural spectrum of colors is so varied that every fancy color diamond is uniquely stunning and expressive in a variety of different ways. Popular colors include yellow, blue, pink, green, violet and the rarest of all – the eye catching red diamonds. These colors, combined with their sparkle and rarity, make fancy color diamonds an incredibly desirable addition to any jewelry collection.</p>
